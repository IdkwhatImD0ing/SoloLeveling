## Inspiration
The app addresses a critical health problem: the sedentary lifestyle epidemic. With increasing numbers of people engaged in desk jobs and spending leisure time in front of screens, physical inactivity has become a pressing concern, linked to a host of chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease.

Furthermore, for many, traditional exercise routines can be monotonous and uninspiring, leading to a lack of long-term commitment to fitness goals. The initial enthusiasm for getting fit often wanes without a compelling, engaging incentive to continue.

Additionally, incorrect exercise form is a widespread issue, often due to a lack of guidance when working out alone. This can result in ineffective workouts or, worse, injury.

Our AR app offers a multifaceted solution:

Gamification: By turning exercise into a series of quests, the app injects fun and a sense of progression into the fitness journey, making the user eager to 'play' again.

Accountability: The quest system encourages regular activity, helping users build and maintain a consistent exercise habit.

Education: Through AR, the app provides real-time feedback on the user's form, ensuring exercises are performed correctly for maximum effectiveness and safety.

Accessibility: As a web app, it's readily available without the need for specialized equipment or gym memberships, making it easier for users to start and stick with their fitness routines.

Community: Users can share their progress and achievements, fostering a sense of community and shared purpose, which is known to be a powerful motivator in maintaining a fitness regimen.

In essence, our app leverages technology to make fitness more enjoyable, habitual, and safe, addressing the root causes of sedentary behavior.
